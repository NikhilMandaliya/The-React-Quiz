# The React Quiz

Welcome to the The React Quiz project!
This project is built for the sole purpose of learning and improving my React skills. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NikhilMandaliya/The-React-Quiz.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd The-React-Quiz
   ```

3. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the fake API server (for simulating backend data):
   We are using [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) so we have to start out server.
  
   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```

6. Start the React application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

7. Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to access the React Quiz application.

## What I Have Learned

Throughout the development of The React Quiz project, I've gained valuable experience and knowledge in several key areas:

**1. Reducers**: I've learned how to use reducers in React to manage complex state logic efficiently. Reducers have allowed me to handle state changes more predictably, making my code more maintainable.

**2. Context API**: Working with the Context API has enabled me to create a centralized store for my application's state. This has made it easier to access and manage state across different components, reducing the need for prop drilling.

**3. useEffect**: I've become proficient in using the useEffect hook to manage side effects in my React components. Whether it's fetching data, subscribing to events, or handling clean-up operations, useEffect has proven to be a versatile tool.

**4. Custom Hooks**: I've created custom hooks to encapsulate and share common stateful logic throughout my application. This has not only improved code organization but also allowed for code reuse across various components.
